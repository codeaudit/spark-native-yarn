/**
 * This class represents a universal Writable with the goal of recognizing 
 * and properly writing/reading multiple types of data.
 * More documentation to follow as its design progresses, but at the moment the mechanism is simple:
 * 1. Prepend each value with a byte representing its type
 * 2. Write value data as byte[]
 * For fixed formats such as Int, Long etc., its standard byte representation is used (e.g., Int = 4 bytes)
 * For Objects (variable length) object serialization is used with custom se/deser to be exposed for 
 * customization and optimization
 * 
 * This class is not public nor it is meant/designed as thread-safe.
